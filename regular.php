Typically, the projects people will be working on will be announced on the mailing list in advance of the meeting. Come along to work on your project, socialise with members, or if you're new, just to find out more about us.</p>

<p>Every Thursday at 1900h there is a themed meetup at the space not only for members but also for those where the themed event is of interest to them. These themed events are free for members to attend. Non-members will be required to pay a fee of Â£5 to help cover the running costs of the space. You can find a list of upcoming Themed Thursdays <a href="/themedthursdays">here</a>.</p>

<p>Every Saturday from 1400h, a keyholder will be available to open the space. The Saturday meetup is for members only who want to work on their projects. Typically, those attending will announce their intention to attend on the mailing list in advance.</p>

<p>Of course, the space is always available for members to access using their swipe card outside of these regular events. If you do not have a key to the front door, it is always a good idea to co-ordinate with one of the keyholders beforehand in case the building has been locked.</p>
